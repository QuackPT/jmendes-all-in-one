Server Staff Guide (JMendes All-In-One)

This guide contains quick notes and procedures for server staff.

1) Basic rules and behavior
- Be helpful and respectful.
- Escalate rule-breaking to admins as per server policy.

2) Common maintenance tasks
- Back up the world and config folders before applying updates.
- When updating quests or loot files, notify players of planned downtime.

3) Importing FTB Quests
- Use the files in overrides/ftbquests. Follow the import steps in overrides/ftbquests/README.md.
- Test new quests on a staging server before deploying live.

4) Troubleshooting
- Missing icons/items: verify the mod that provides the item is installed and loaded.
- Quest triggers not firing: confirm the server-side detection plugin/mod is compatible and enabled.

5) Contact
- For pack-level issues, contact the pack maintainer (QuackPT) or open an issue in the repository.
